# utility-scripts

This is a set of bash scripts I wrote in order to make life easier.

### g-update

List of commands to fully update (and after that clean) a debian-based system.

### removeaudio

This script can remove the audio track from any video. Once in a folder, select the extension (mp4, mov, etc...) and the audio track will be deleted from all the videos with the selected extension.
